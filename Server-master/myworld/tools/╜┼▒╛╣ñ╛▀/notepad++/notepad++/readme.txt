Notepad++ release Note :

What is Notepad++?
******************

Notepad++ is a generic source editor (it tries to be anyway) and Notepad replacement written in C++ with the win32 API. The aim of Notepad++ is to offer a slim and efficient binary with a totally customizable GUI.

Why another source editor?
**************************

I worked for a big smart card company as engineer developer, and I took charge of looking for an alternative solution for an internal tool coded in Java. The internal tool needed an edit component, and I found Scintilla (which allows me to develop in C++) via Internet. I began my conception and development in this project.

Unfortunately the project is abandoned after 3 months. The reason is political : our company will use a new environment of development, as well a property language, to re-develop all internal tools. All the developers are forced to use this unstable and uncomfortable IDE and the incoherent property language.

As a C++/Java developer, I decided to continue the project with my spare time. The prototype of project was already done, I removed the components which depend on the specification of abandoned project - It made a generic code editor. Then I made it available on sourceforge and I continue to improve it : that's the beginning of Notepad++.

So you asked me "Why another source editor", the answer that I can give you is :
"Why not? Since I enjoy myself with it."
